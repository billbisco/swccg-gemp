 * Set: Virtual Block 3
 * Type: Starship
 * Subtype: Capital
 * Title: Jabba's Space Cruiser (V)

 * PC-E1 version of 1230_55: the PC website card list text (by 2012-07-21 to 2013-01-11; the list was generated
 * from the PC's Holotable card data). Then the PC card image (server upload 2013-02-25) and the Master List of 2013-04-27 (PC-E2, the current card) prints the
 * release-sheet wording again (Bill 2026-11-11: every publication is a version; batch R8). Same play. Anything
 * Goes only (docs/legacy-versions.md).
